# Elderly Care Application

## Introduction

This web application aims to provide personalized caregiver matching services for elderly individuals in need of assistance with daily activities and health care. By leveraging advanced algorithms and user input, we streamline the process of connecting elderly users with caregivers who meet their specific requirements, including location, health needs, and qualifications.

## Features

- **Personalized Caregiver Matching**: Users can input their location and health needs to be matched with available caregivers who possess the necessary qualifications and expertise.
- **Qualification Assessment**: Caregivers' qualifications, experience level, specialized skills, availability, and location are assessed to prioritize matching with elderly individuals.
- **Feedback and Ratings**: Implement a feedback system where elderly users can rate and review their caregiving experiences to continually assess caregivers' performance.
